# Naive Bayes Classifier from scratch

Naive Bayes Classifier is a very popular supervised machine learning algorithm based on Bayesâ€™ theorem. It is simple but very powerful algorithm which works well with large datasets and sparse matrices, like pre-processed text data which creates thousands of vectors depending on the number of words in a dictionary. It works really well with text data projects like sentiment data analysis, performs good with document categorization projects, and also it is great in predicting categorical data in projects such as email spam classification.

In this notebook, I will build a Naive Bayes Classifier class and test it on [iris](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) dataset and [spambase](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/spambase) dataset. And comparision between my function and sklearn would be provided as well.
